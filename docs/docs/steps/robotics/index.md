# Robotics Steps

Steps for robotics applications including coordinate transformations, camera projections, and conversions between vector and field representations.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [CoordinateTransformation](coordinate_transformation.md) | Rigid body transform of 3D vectors between coordinate frames |
| [FieldToVectors](field_to_vectors.md) | Converts a 3D field to a set of 3D position vectors |
| [PinHoleBackProjector](pinhole_back_projector.md) | Back-projects a depth image to 3D points using a pinhole camera model |
| [RangeImageToVectors](range_image_to_vectors.md) | Converts a spherical range image to Cartesian vectors |
| [VectorsToField](vectors_to_field.md) | Embeds 3D position vectors into a 3D occupancy field |
| [VectorsToRangeImage](vectors_to_range_image.md) | Projects Cartesian vectors into a spherical range image |
